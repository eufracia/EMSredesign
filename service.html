                    <h3> Customizable Exam Configuration Options </h3>
                    <p> EMSprep.com has spared no expense in purchasing the highly acclaimed T2 Platform to deliver our exams online.
                    Although there were many exam engines available for considerably less cost, the T2 engine is so robust that it was
                    the hands down, team favorite.  What makes the engine so great is that it offers our EMSprep.com customers the ability
                    to customize each and every practice exam, and also receive immediate question feedback and scores.  If you have ever
                    studied using a paper based exam guide, you'll know what a time waster it is to mark your own exams and then erase
                    your answers so you can start again. </p>
                    <p> With every EMSprep.com exam you'll be able to
                    customize the following exam attributes: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> The Time Limit </li>
                        <li> The Total Number of Questions </li>
                        <li> The Categories of Questions served on the
                            exam </li>
                        <li> Show Running Right and Wrong Totals </li>
                        <li> Mark Questions on the Fly </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p> What's really great about this kind of flexibility is you have full control over how long you want to study for,
                    how the exam is graded, and most importantly what categories of questions you study.  With other exam prep products
                    you will most likely be forced to study question categories that you either don't want to study or
                    already feel comfortable with. There is no other EMS study system like this on the internet! </p>
